## Steps
**First step**: click the "Fork" button in the top right corner of the repo, to create your own version of this repo. Then you can use the below check-list to complete the tasks.

*Then in your own fork:* Check off the tasks below as you complete them by putting an `x` in the square brackets like `- [x]`:
- [x] Go to [github.com](https://github.com) > click your profile picture (top right corner) > Your Profile
    * In the left sidebar tap "Edit profile" and set:
      - [x] Profile picture. Use a real professional picture, a cartoon that represents you, or use some AI image tool to generate a cartoon version from a real photo of you.
         * Have no photo of you on the computer/web? Take a new photo or an existing one and either email it too yourself, or upload it to [tmpfiles](https://tmpfiles.org/) and then he open upload URL on the computer.
         * Image tools:
            * Generate many different professional profile pictures from a real picture with [newprofilepic.com](https://newprofilepic.com/)
            * Cartoonize by [fotor](https://www.fotor.com/features/photo-to-cartoon/)
            * Cartoon by [picsart](https://picsart.com/photo-effects/photo-to-cartoon/)
       - [x] About me
       - [x] Other data like links to social profiles (LinkedIn, Twitter, ...)

- [x] In the top right toolbar: click "+" > "New repository". Enter the following data:
    * Repository name: **exactly** the same name as your GitHub username.
    * Initialize this repository with: check "Add a README file"
    * Leave all others to default and press the "Create repository" button.

- [x] Edit your profile `README.md` in your new repo `https://github.com/your_username/your_username`:
    - [x] Start with a template
       * Click the :pencil2: icon on the `README.md` below the file list to start editing the file right in your browser.
         * Remember to publish your edits from time to time by pressing the "Commit changes" button in the top right corner.
       * Start with the [template](#simple-profile-template) below. Copy it and paste it into your `README.md` (replace whatever was already in this file).

    - [x] Write about yourself! Use this Markdown syntax [guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).
       * Make good use of [emojis](https://github.com/ikatyang/emoji-cheat-sheet)
           e.g. `:computer:` -> :computer:
       * Add some badges to show your preferences:
           * https://home.aveek.io/GitHub-Profile-Badges/
           * https://github.com/alexandresanlim/Badges4-README.md-Profile
           * shields.io icons can be selected from [here](https://simpleicons.org/)
       * Maybe you want to generate your own Octocat (GitHub logo animal) that represents you.
           * Generate at https://myoctocat.com/
           * Download the result, rename the file to `octocat.png`,  and upload it to your profile repo in the browser. Go to your profile and locate the "Add file" button above the file list.
           * Insert the image in your README.md. Here we use HTML tag to change the size of the image to be a bit smaller:
              * `<img src="octocat.png" width="30%" />`.
                
   - [x] When done: make sure to run your text through a [spell checker](https://languagetool.org/). Paste in your whole Markdown text.
